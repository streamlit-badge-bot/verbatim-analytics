## ❓ How it Works
### Top Keywords
* <b>Step 1: Upload data</b>
    \n In the sidebar, upload your file for text analysis by clicking browse or dropping the file. 
    The file should have a .xlsx or .csv filename extension, contain more than 1 row and have at least one column (two if with categories). 
* <b>Step 2: Select Column</b>
    \n After reading the file, select the column name where text is. A data preview is also shown in the page for a quick overview of the contents.
    You can also select to have your analysis done per category by selecting the column name where categories can be found. The default value is <i>None</i> which means an overall analysis will be conducted.
* <b>Step 3: Data Preprocessing and Top Word Extraction (automated)</b>
    \n Data cleaning process will be initiated which includes character/slang/jargon subtitutions, words removal and text normalization.
    Extracts words using ngrams (unigram, bigram, trigram) and counts its occurence in the document.
    Unigrams are one word text, bigrams are two-word text which appeared consecutively and trigrams are three-word text. 
* <b>Step 3: Configure Chart and Display Options</b>
    - Color Palette - change color palette of the bar chart from the options listed
    - Number of Keywords - modify the number of top words displayed based on occurences/count. In case of a tie, both words will be displayed and treated as one.
    - Omit Words - select which word/s you wish to remove in the chart
* <b>Step 4: Download data</b>
